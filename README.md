<h2> The Association Between Anxiety and Gambling Behaviors </h2>
  
<p>This repository contains an abridged research paper detailing the study conducted in my Applied Data Analysis class that I took in the spring semester 
of my sophomore year(2022), the .R file used for data management and to conduct statistical tests, and the final project presentation poster.</p>
  
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong></p>
<p>This study examines the relationship between anxiety diagnosis and certain gambling behaviors and uses data collected from the first wave of the 
  National Epidemiologic Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized adults in the 
  U.S. The survey indicated a sample size of 11,125 adults. Lifetime anxiety diagnoses were made using the NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated 
  Disabilities Interview Schedule – DSM-IV (AUDADIS-IV). Four different gambling behaviors were assessed based off 4 questions: (1) “Ever gamble to 
  get out of a bad mood?”, (2) ”Ever gamble to forget your problems?”, (3) “More than once tried to quit gambling, but couldn’t do it?”, and 
  (4) “Ever have job or school trouble because of gambling?” The study found that for 3 of the 4 gambling behaviors, there was a statistically significant 
  positive association between anxiety diagnosis and the gambling behavior. The association between anxiety diagnosis and (3) “More than once tried to 
  quit gambling, but couldn’t do it?” was found to be insignificant. Additionally, this study controlled for age by separating adults into generation 
  groups ranging from 0 (Millennials) to 5 (Greatest Generation), and found that the same 3 behaviors that were previously significant remained 
  significant across generational groups, and that the association between anxiety diagnosis and (3) “More than once tried to quit gambling, but 
  couldn’t do it?” remained not significant. </p>
